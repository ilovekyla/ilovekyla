### ðŸ‘‹ Hello there!
#

Not much to say about me, I'm not particularly well rounded in a specific language as I know bits of multiple languages. I hope to get better and specialize in Python and C++ eventually as I progress more into programming. I don't really use social media so the best way to reach me would be through my twitter which you can find below.
